# Stacked Ensemble Models for RMST Prediction

This repository contains the code and datasets used in the analysis of RMST (Restricted Mean Survival Time) predictions utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and a stacked ensemble method to enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked ensemble methods in medical data analysis, particularly focusing on improving the predictive performance of RMST outcomes. We explore the integration of multiple predictive models to achieve higher precision and reliability.
